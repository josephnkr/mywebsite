<h1>Welcome to a brief history of coffee.</h1>
<p>
<h2>What is coffee?</h2>
    <img width="auto" height="315" src="Coffee%20-%20Imgur.gif" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</p>
<p>
  Coffee is a brewed drink that is made from the roasted nuts of the Coffea fruit.  The Coffea fruit comes from any plant in the Coffea genus.
</p>
<h2>Coffea fruit?</h2>
  <img src="coffee-beans.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>
  The Coffee plant grows naturally in Ethopia.  However cultivation is taking places in the tropical a lot of countries from Brazil to Yemen.  There are many species in the Coffea genus.  However there are there are really only two species we've all drank in the form of coffee.
  <ul>
      <li>Coffea Canephora</li>
      <li>Coffea Arabica</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>The Legend of Kaldi.</h2>
  <img src="boy with kid.jpg" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>
  There are no written records of when the roasted coffee bean/nut was first brewed to make the coffee beverage we know of today.  However if you can trust that <em>Homer</em> recited the entire <u>Illiad</u>, surely you can trust the oral legend of Kaldi.  Kaldi was a shepherd in Ethiopia who noticed that his goats would not go to sleep.  He noticed that they become restless at night after consuming berries from a certain plant.  So Kaldi decided to try the berries himself.  Of course, this legend explains that the Coffea fruit is edible.  However I don't think it explains the act of roasting the nut itself and then brewing it in coffee.  The coffee bean/nut is not chewable.  The roasting part probably came later.
</p>
<h2>Who is <em>Helen of Troy</em>?</h2>
  <img src="grecian lady.png" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>
  Now Helen of Troy is suppose to be the most beautiful woman in the world.  However could she also been a drug dealer in the guise of an enchantress and diviner.  I begin my journey with the ancient Greek drink <em>nepenthes pharmakon</em> in the epic of the <u>Odyssey</u> by <em>Homer</em> with this excerpt: "she put a drug into the wine to quiet all pain and strife, and bring forgetfulness of every ill." So whatever this drug is exactly, no one knows, but some historians guess it's <em>coffee</em>.  So coffee could have helped start a ten year war that saw the end of Troy?  Could coffee have helped bring forth the epic of the <u>Illiad</u>?  By the way, the <u>Illiad</u> was required reading for anyone who called themselves educated in ancient Greece and Rome.  It records the first time someone, namely <em>Achilles</em> questioned the authority of a king, namely <em>Agamemnon</em>.  It ushered in the importance of <em>Grammar</em>, <em>Logic</em>, and <em>Rhetoric</em>, which are at the very heart of Western education.  I could go on at this topic, but it's for another day.

<h2>Coffee as sedative?</h2>
  <img src="coffee-cup.jpg" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>
  When we don't know if Nephene was wine with coffee, we do know coffee has Caffiene.  According to an abstract from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/605627">US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health</a>, caffiene in coffee can cause an increase dopamine levels.  And dopamine is the brains natural "sedative".  So yes it can cause you to calm down after causing a stimulation of everything else in the body.
</p>
<h2>Not the only brewed/alcoholic drink in the house.</h2>
  <img src="mexican-breakfast.jpg" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>
  Coffee was not the only brewed drink in history.  After all tea is dried and then dipped in water to make tea.  Even in the Bible, Esau might have been preparing a brewed drink along with the Venison he was making for his father Isaac.  So you can say that drying was a way to preserved something before refrigerators were invented.  Also there are still drinks out there where liquor is combined with coffee.  So Nephene might not have been Coffee and Wine.  What ever it was, it would definitely be awesome if it was coffee.
</p>
<h2>Before <em>Coffee</em> there was <em>bunchum</em>.</h2>
  <img src="old-books.jpg" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>
  In one of the oldest known medical encyclopedias known to us, <u>Kitab al-Hawi fi al-tibb</u> or <u>The Comprehensive Book on Medicine</u> depending on who's translation your reading, refers to a plant called the <em>Bun</em> of which you can make a drink call the <em>Bunchum</em>.  While it can be a root or other than coffee plant, if it is the coffee we know and love, then knowledge of coffee can be dated to the 850s.  So when Coffee plant became cultivated in Yemen, it was not referred to as Coffee.  In fact it is referred to by the Ethiopian name "Bun".  Slowly it became known as coffee.  In fact we can only infer that the coffee term "coffee" was taken from the Arabic word, "qah' wa", which really refers a wine or an appetite suppressor.  Since liquor is non-Islamic, the brewed coffee drink we know today probably took the place of wine as an appetite suppressor.  While historians dispute that coffee could have been used in the world of Divination, it's still more possible that coffee was used in the world of medicine.  In the Rhazes' encyclopedia the al-Hawi, or <em>al-Razi</em>, <em>bunchum</em> is a drink that is good for the stomache.
