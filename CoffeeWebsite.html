<h1>Welcome to the history of coffee</h1>
<p>

Coffee plant, especifically "Coffea Arabica", grows naturally in Ethopia.  No one know when the coffee bean/nut was first used
exactly brewed to make the coffee we know of today.  In fact we can only infer that the coffee term "coffee" was taken from 
the Arabic word, "qah' wa".  We do know that coffee is the 2nd most popular drink around the world, with tea being first.
For further reading on coffee, may I recommend "<u>Coffee: A Comprehensive Guide to the Bean, the Beverage, and the Industry.</u>" by
Robert W. Thurston, Jonathan Morris, Shawn Steiman.

However, I am fascinated with two things.  That would be Coffee and History. 

I begin my journey with the ancient Greek drink "nepenthes pharmakan" in the epic of the <u>Odyssey</u> by Homer
with this excerpt: "she put a drug into the wine to quiet all pain and strife, and bring forgetfulness of every ill."
So whatever this drug is exactly, no one knows, but some historians guess its coffee.  Personally, there are many drugs 
out there that can do the same thing.  In fact the plant in being referred to above could be extinct by all accounts.
However, since the term coffee is a borrowed word from Arabic, we would still have to take the drinks description over
its name.  

So does coffee have a calming affect?  According to an abstract from the US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Healthj
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov the caffiene in coffee can be cause an increase level of dopamine.  And dopamine is the 
brains "sedative".  So yes it can cause you to calm down after causing a sitimulation of everything else in the body.

So we can stretch to say, "Coffee was the reason the Hellenics and Trojans went to war for a decade" before the Illiad
abruptly ends with the burial of Hector.

While historians dispute that coffee could have been used in the world of Divination, its still more possible that 
coffee was used in the world of medicine.

Before we can talk about the brew drink of today, we should not forget
that the first reference to a coffee for medicine was found in one of the oldest encyclopedias of medicine.  
The oldest know encyclopedia called <u>Kitab al-Hawi fi al-tibb</u> or <u>The Comprehensive Book on Medicine</u> depending
on who's translation your reading, refers to a plant called the Bun of which you can make a drink call the Bunchum.  While
it can be a root or other than coffee plant, if it is the coffee we know and love, then knowledge of coffee can be dated
to the 850s.

How ever there seems to be a few references to a drinksin which it is brewed from something dried like a coffee bean.
You can even find references to these drinks in the bible.

I'll end my rant at this point.  Because after this, coffee finds its way from Yemen, the Turks, and then to the Austrians.
